Dear Engineer Atiaf,
Thanks for submitting your homework. You're a good engineer and I wish you the best. 
There are some things that you need to pay attention for it
First of all, try to copy your code from Visual Studio Code instead of taking a picture of it,
Second, submit the discussions for lec-0- and lec-1-
