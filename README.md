Dear Engineer Atiaf,

Thanks for submitting your homework. You're a good engineer, and I wish you the best.
There are some things that you need to pay attention for it:
First of all, try to copy your code from Visual Studio Code instead of taking a picture of it,
Second, submit all discussions for all lectures in this repo; don't create a repo for each discussion. 
So I'm looking forward to seeing all your assignments submitted here in this repo.
